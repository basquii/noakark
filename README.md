# Frontend Mentor - Arch Studio multi-page website

![Design preview for the Arch Studio multi-page website coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challengeüëã

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the contact page map. The addresses we have on the design are fictional, so you'll need to add real addresses for this bonus task.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT** ‚ö†Ô∏è: If you choose to do the bonus part of the challenge and use a mapping API, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). It's free to use and doesn't require an API Key. If you decide to use another API, like Google Maps or Mapbox, be sure to secure your API Key. Here are guides for both Google Maps and Mapbox, be sure to read through them thoroughly:
